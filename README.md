Same Instructions as on Codio to Compile and Run

For all parts, first
```
cd hw4
```

For part 2, compile the rudimentary test file with
```
make equal-paths-test
```
And Run it with
```
./equal-paths-test
```

For part 2 in-depth tests, first
```
cd hw4_tests/equalpaths-test
```
And then compile with 
```
make equalpaths_tests
```
Then, run tests with
```
./equalpaths_tests
```

For part 3 and 4, compile the rudimentary test file with
```
make bst-test
```
And Run it with
```
./bst-test
```

For part 3 in-depth tests, first
```
cd hw4_tests/bst_tests
```
And then compile with 
```
make bst_tests
```
Then, run tests with
```
./bst_tests
```

For part 4 in-depth tests, first
```
cd hw4_tests/avl_tests
```
And then compile with 
```
make avl_tests
```
Then, run tests with
```
./avl_tests
```

You can then run valgrind on any of the above executables
