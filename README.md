Same Instructions as on Codio to Compile and Run

For Parts 1 and 2, first
```
cd hw4
```

Then, compile the rudimentary test file with
```
make bst-test
```
And Run it with
```
./bst-test
```

or part 1 in-depth tests, first
```
cd hw4_tests/bst_tests
```
And then compile with 
```
make bst_tests
```
Then, run tests with
```
./bst_tests
```

For part 2 in-depth tests, first
```
cd hw4_tests/avl_tests
```
And then compile with 
```
make avl_tests
```
Then, run tests with
```
./avl_tests
```

You can then run valgrind on any of the above executables
